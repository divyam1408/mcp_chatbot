    "summary": "Modified Newtonian potentials have been proposed for the description of relativistic effects acting on particles and fluids in permanent orbital motion around black holes. Here we further discuss spherically symmetric potentials like the one proposed by Artemova, Bjornson & Novikov (1996, Astrophysical Journal, 461, 565), and we illustrate their virtues by studying the acceleration along circular trajectories. We compare the results with exact expressions in the spacetime of a rotating (Kerr) black hole.",

    "summary": "The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from binary black hole (BBH) coalescences by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration has raised fundamental questions about the genesis of these events. In this chapter, we explore the possibility that PBHs, proposed candidates for dark matter, may serve as the progenitors of the BBHs observed by LVK. Employing a Bayesian analysis, we constrain the PBH model using the LVK third GW Transient Catalog (GWTC-3), revealing that stellar-mass PBHs cannot dominate cold dark matter. Considering a mixed population of astrophysical black holes (ABHs) and PBHs, we determine that approximately $1/4$ of the detectable events in the GWTC-3 can be attributed to PBH binaries. We also forecast detectable event rate distributions for PBH and ABH binaries by the third-generation ground-based GW detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope, offering a potential avenue to distinguish PBHs from ABHs based on their distinct redshift evolutions.",

    "summary": "This is the second lecture of `RAGtime' series on electrodynamical effects near black holes. We will summarize the basic equations of relativistic electrodynamics in terms of spin-coefficient (Newman-Penrose) formalism. The aim of the lecture is to present important relations that hold for exact electro-vacuum solutions and to exhibit, in a pedagogical manner, some illustrative solutions and useful approximation approaches. First, we concentrate on weak electromagnetic fields and we illustrate their structure by constructing the magnetic and electric lines of force. Gravitational field of the black hole assumes axial symmetry, whereas the electromagnetic field may or may not share the same symmetry. With these solutions we can investigate the frame-dragging effects acting on electromagnetic fields near a rotating black hole. These fields develop magnetic null points and current sheets. Their structure suggests that magnetic reconnection takes place near the rotating black hole horizon. Finally, the last section will be devoted to the transition from test-field solution to exact solutions of coupled Einstein-Maxwell equations. New effects emerge within the framework of exact solutions: the expulsion of the magnetic flux out of the black-hole horizon depends on the intensity of the imposed magnetic field.",
